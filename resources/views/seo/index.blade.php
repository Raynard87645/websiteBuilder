                <h1>The Impact of Search Engine Optimization</h1>
              	 <p>Making a beautiful and responsive website is only one step toward increased recognition. Websites need a steady flow of visitors. A crucial key to attracting visitors to your page is to secure a high listing on Google’s search results. With over 2.3 million Google searches performed every minute, search engines are a go-to tool for those in need of goods and services. SEO entails a wide array of strategies implemented to ensure that businesses’ websites are the first thing Google users see upon making a search.</p>

                  <h3>YOUR SEO PARTNER</h3>
             		<p>Creating an elegant, user-friendly website is just the beginning in the website design process. Even if you have the most creatively designed site on the internet, it won't do you any good if no one can find it. SEO is a complex and methodical process. It is not a one-and-done deal. Without the continuous monthly attention of an SEO professional, your site's search results can suffer. According to Search Engine Watch, first page search results garner 95% of all search traffic.
