                <h1>Importance of Website Design and Development</h1>
              	 <p>
					
					Your customers are most likely interacting with your business online first.  The first impression is the most important, as it sets their expectations of your brand. With smartphone usage increasing (Mobile and tablet internet usage accounts for 51.3% of the worldwide traffic according to StatsCounter), our web development NJ team believes it is important to have the mindset of “mobile first” as it may be the only way your customer interacts with your business.</p>

             	<p>
				Designing and developing websites that are optimized for tablets, phones, and other mobile devices is an important part of the work we do at Clikz Digital. All of our websites are created using the latest practices in responsive design. Responsive website design technology employs flexible grids, flexible images and media queries to adjust content and page elements accordingly. Visitors can browse from desktops, tablets, or smartphones and the website will dynamically resize according to the device’s screen.

	                  <h3>BENEFITS OF RESPONSIVE DESIGN</h3>
	             	<ul>
	             		<li>
	             			<p><b>Supports Multiple Devices</b> – According to recent government numbers, 56% of American adults own a smartphone and 34% own a tablet. Responsive design ensures users can access content at home or on the go.</p>
	             		</li>
	             		<li>
	             			<p><b>Improves Usability</b> – Through the use of media queries the width of the browser is determined and the appropriate content is served. This fluid response to various devices makes it easier to navigate and find information.</p>
	             		</li>
	             		<li>
	             			<p><b>Increases Performance</b> – Mobile users are always looking for information quickly and easily. Responsive design optimizes site code such as HTML, which improves loading times and site speed, keeping users on site longer.</p>
	             		</li>
	             		<li> 
	             		  <p><b>Improves Google Ranking</b> - Because over half of all website traffic is through mobile devices, gridsoogle will actually lower your ranking if the site is not mobile-friendly.</p>
	             	    </li>
	             	</ul>
