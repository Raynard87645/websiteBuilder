                <h1>Why Landing Pages Matter?</h1>
              	 <p>
					Youâ€™ve done an awesome job building up your brand and your website represents all the products and services you offer. Your hardwork has paid off and sales are steady, but how do you convert more visitors in customers? That is where landing pages come into play. Landing pages are used as an effective lead conversion tool.</p>

                  <h3>WHAT IS A LANDING PAGE (VS A WEBSITE)?</h3>
             	<p>
				A landing page is any web page that consumers can land on. It is normally a stand-alone page that is different than your homepage (or any other pages) with a single and focused purpose.  A landing page is a follow-up to any promises that have been made in your content marketing efforts (blogs, social media, and advertisements). These landing pages are used to trade contact information in exchange for some sort of special offer, promotion, or deal, with the ultimate goal of converting visitors into customers.
