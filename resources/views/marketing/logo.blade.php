                <h1>Digital Advertising: Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and Social Ads</h1>
              	 <p>
              	 Effective advertising methods that tend to yield results relatively quickly are pay-per-click ads and social ads. Both are heavily used by businesses and as a result, frequent users on pages like Google and Facebook likely see hundreds of examples of these advertisements on a monthly basis. They are ideal for reaching a target audience quickly and effectively.  </p>

                  <h3>WHAT IS PAY-PER-CLICK?</h3>
                 	<p>
    				        Pay-per-click ads are typically featured on high-traffic websites with many users. These ads are displayed on the page and usually marked with indicators such as “Ad” or “Sponsored”. The host website is paid every time a visitor clicks on one of the featured ads, hence the name “pay-per-click”.

                  <h3>WHAT ARE SOCIAL ADS?</h3>
                   	<p>
      				        This intelligent variant of advertising takes many forms. These ads can appear as normal social media posts or simply as more obvious and easily identified ads. Another fascinating aspect of social ads is the ability to direct your advertisements toward a particular target demographic based on their online activity, instead of publishing advertisements on a wider scale. This reduces spending and provides optimal results by attracting potential clients who are already inclined to take an interest in your brand.
